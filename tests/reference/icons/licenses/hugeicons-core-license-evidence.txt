## Agent skill

[`skills/hugeicons`](skills/hugeicons) is an [agent skill](https://www.skills.sh) that gives coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and other AI coding agents accurate, first-party guidance on using Hugeicons — so they stop guessing icon names and props from stale training data.

One skill covers every framework. The agent detects which one a project uses and applies the right component, props, and icon catalog:

- **Detect → install → render → props** for React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, Angular, React Native, and Flutter
- The complete icon catalog — [`references/icon-list.md`](skills/hugeicons/references/icon-list.md) for the shared JS exports and [`references/icon-list-flutter.md`](skills/hugeicons/references/icon-list-flutter.md) for Flutter constants — so names are copied, never invented
- Free vs Pro guidance, plus minimal-code conventions (only pass props that override a default)

Install it with the [`skills`](https://www.skills.sh) CLI from your project root — your agent picks it up on the next session:

```bash
npx skills add hugeicons/hugeicons
```

<br/>

## Quick start

Here's React. Every other framework follows the same shape (see each package's README for details):

```jsx
import { HugeiconsIcon } from '@hugeicons/react';
import { SearchIcon } from '@hugeicons/core-free-icons';

function App() {
  return (
    <HugeiconsIcon
      icon={SearchIcon}
      size={24}
      color="currentColor"
      strokeWidth={1.5}
    />
  );
}
```

The framework libraries are renderers. The icons themselves come from:

- **Free:** [`@hugeicons/core-free-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hugeicons/core-free-icons) (6,000+ icons)
- **Pro:** `@hugeicons-pro/core-*` (60,000+ icons across 10 styles)

<br/>
